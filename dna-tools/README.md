# 🔬 Biopython Basics: DNA to RNA & Reverse Complement

This script demonstrates how to work with DNA sequences using [Biopython](https://biopython.org/):

✅ Transcribe DNA to RNA  
✅ Get the reverse complement of a DNA strand

---

## 📦 Requirements

Make sure Biopython is installed:

```bash
pip install biopython
```
---

## 🧪 Example Output

Original DNA Sequence:         ATGCGTACGTTAG
Transcribed RNA Sequence:      AUGCGUACGUUAG
Reverse Complement of DNA:     CTAAACGTACGCAT

---


## 📘 Notes
Seq is the main sequence object in Biopython.

.transcribe() turns DNA into RNA (T becomes U).

.reverse_complement() gets the reverse of the complementary DNA strand.
